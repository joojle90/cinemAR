Anya, who happens to be a doll maker, happily took the doll at home and placed it in her room. However, Niken, their neighbor, was shocked to see the doll. The doll’s name is Ghawiah, which means one who is evil and follows its desires. It is said that the doll belonged to a little girl named Uci who died when she and her family were brutally murdered in a robbery. Strange things start to happen, including the doll moving by itself, the doorbell ringing with no one outside, and the voice of a little girl in the middle of the night. ",
